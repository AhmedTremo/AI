# Project Description
Using search you should formulate a plan that Ethan can follow to complete the mission. An optimal plan is one where the deaths are at a minimum as a first condition. Given two plans with the same number of deaths, the more optimal plan is the one where the total damage incurred by the IMF members is minimal. The following search strategies will be implemented and each will be used to help Ethan:
1. Breadth-first search.
2. Depth-first search.
3. Iterative deepening search.
4. Uniform-cost search.
5. Greedy search with at least two heuristics.
6. A* search with at least two admissible heuristics.
